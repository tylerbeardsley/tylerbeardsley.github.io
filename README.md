Assignment 1 Comp 20: Resume, Bio, and Home Page

1. As far as I can tell all aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly.
2. I spoke very briefly with Dorian Pistili about this assignment.
3. It took me about 5 hours to complete this assignment.

This assigment led me to create my own homepage that contains an image of myself and two links - one to my online resume and one to a short bio I wrote about myself. The project is separated into 4 files: index.html, resume.html, bio.html, and a CSS stylesheet basic_style.css. I have also made it so that my Tufts website will now redirect you to my GitHub website.
