			<h3> A Short Bio of Tyler </h3>
		</header>
		<p></p>
		<p> Tyler Beardsley is currently a Junior at Tufts Univsersity studying Computer Science and Drama. Tyler hails from rural Maine where his parents are teachers and his four younger siblings attend school. Tyler has been heavily involved in the arts since he was young and continues to perform at Tufts. However, even though he loves the arts he also enjoys the stability of the sciences. Thus, he has decided to pursue both roads until either one takes a dive or one rockets off. When Tyler is not performing or coding you can find him playing board games, DMing a 3.5 campaign of Dungeons and Dragons, or jamming out to some RHCP. </p>
