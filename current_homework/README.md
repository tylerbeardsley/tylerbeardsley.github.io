##COMP 20 Project##

###Title:###
 Fitness Finder

###Problem Statement:###
 You want to get in shape, lose weight, or just exercise in general but you want to know where the near-by gyms are and how good they are. You want real reviews written by real users. 

###Solution:###
 An application that lists all the gyms in the area according to the user's location. The index page (landing page) will be a map centered on the user's location with markers displaying all the near-by gyms. When the user clicks on a marker he's redirected to that gym's show page. Every gym has a show-page where users can add reviews. 

###User Scenarios & Features:###
+ A user creates an account and gives permission to use their location. 
+ Upon signing-in, user arrives at landing page (map with markers)
+ If user want's to know more about a gym he can click on a marker
+ User can search for gyms
+ Clicking on a marker will redirect user to appropriate show page.
+ On gym show page user can add a review and upvote/downvote other reviews
+ User can review different features of gym (emphasis on yoga, martial arts, etc...)

###Pick 5:###
+ Geolocation
+ Front-end Framework (Bootstrap)
+ Reporting with charts and graphs
+ Server-side data persistence (PostgreSQL)
+ Send email, SMSes, or push notifications

###What data will we be collecting:###
+ Data related with user's (email, name, location)
+ Reviews associated to gyms

###Algorithms/Special Techniques we will use:###
+ Upvoting/downvoting algorithm
+ Searching algorithms (related to name, overall review rating, and also different features)
