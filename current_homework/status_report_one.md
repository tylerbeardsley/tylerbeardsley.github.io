###What we accomplished this week:###

Now that our class is starting to get into the server side of things,
our team did some more research into how we want to be storing data
and we have decided to switch over from our original idea of using
PostgreSQL to MongoDB - simply because we are going to get more practice
with it in class and feel it will easily cover the data storage that we need.

We also started coding a sign up page where users can input their name and
email, and then receive an email saying "Welcome to Fitness Finder".

Also started with basic styling for sign in page. Having trouble setting up background image.

###Challenges and issues our team faced this week:###

This was an extremely busy week for most of our team so we did not get
as much coding done as we hoped. We need to meet up with each other soon
so that we can have a plan for how we want to split up coding and/or find
some time to code together. Probably going to create a Doodle soon to find
the best time for all of us.

###Goals for next week:###

Luckily for as busy this week was next week looks a lot less busy for
everyone. With this in mind, our team is looking to get together a few times
to get a big chunk of the code started so that we all feel comfortable
splitting up and working on our own sections.

When users will enter the link to our website they will land on a landing page which prompts them for username and password. Then they are redirected to our main page (the map)

### Comments by Ming
* Is a background image really that important?
* Forget Doodle, have you considered Skype or Google Hangouts?
